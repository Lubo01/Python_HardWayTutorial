# Exercise 7 More Printing exercises

# simple text (string) printing
print "Mary had a little lamb."
# text printing with conversion of string: 
# %s (converts any python object using str()).
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'
print "And everywhere that Mary went."
print "." * 10 # what`d that do? repetition of dot 10 times

# setting variable value (string type):
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

#watch that comma at the end. try removing it to see what happens
#with comma, result connects both lines into one row. 
#   without comma we get 2 separate rows
#we could put both lines into one, but it would be longer than 80 characters,
#   which in Python is bad style.
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
