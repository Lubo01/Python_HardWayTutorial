46 A Project Skeleton

Installing Python Packages

1. pip from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
2. distribute from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute
3. nose from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose
4. virtualenv from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

Do not just download these packages and install them by hand.
Instead, see how other people recommend you install these packages
and use them for your particular system. The process will be different
for most versions of Linux, OSX, and definitely different for Windows.
