#Exercise 34: Accessing Elements of Lists

#Python starts its lists at 0 rather than 1
#Remember: usually we use numbers as ordinal == ordered, 1st; 
#but program usually use numbers as cardinal == cards at random, 0

#setup a list
animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']

#call list items
animals [0]		#'bear'
animals [2]		#'peacock'
animals [ 5 ]	#'platypus'
animals[1]		#'python'
#etc...
